Four-Agent Deep Research Pipeline CLI
Implements the Four-Agent Deep Research Pipeline with Triage, Clarifier, Instruction Builder, and Research Agents.

Usage: 
    python complex-cli.py "Your research question here"

Examples:
    python cli/complex-cli.py "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
    python cli/complex-cli.py "How has climate change affected Arctic ice coverage in the last decade?"
    python cli/complex-cli.py "What are the economic impacts of remote work on urban real estate markets?"
    python cli/complex-cli.py "Compare the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccines"
