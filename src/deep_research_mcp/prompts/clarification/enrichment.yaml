template: |
  Original Query: "{user_query}"
  
  Additional Context from User:
  {enriched_context}
  
  Based on the original query and the additional context, create an enriched, more specific research query that incorporates the user's clarifications. 
  
  Guidelines:
  - Keep the core intent of the original query
  - Make it more precise and actionable
  - Incorporate the user's specified preferences and constraints
  - Maintain natural language flow
  - Don't over-complicate - aim for clarity and focus
  
  Return only the enriched query, nothing else.
